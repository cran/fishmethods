\arguments{
  \item{year}{vector containing the time series of numeric year labels.}
  \item{catch}{vector containing the time series of catch data (in weight). Missing values are not
   allowed.}
  \item{catchCV}{vector containing the time series of coefficients of variation associated with catch 
           if resampling of catch is desired; otherwise, catchCV = NULL. }
  \item{catargs}{list arguments associated with resampling of catch. \code{dist} is the specification 
      of the resampling distribution to use ("none" = no resampling, "unif"=uniform, "norm" = normal, 
      and "lnorm" =log-normal). If "lnorm" is selected, catch is log transformed and standard deviation
      on the log scale is calculated from the specificed CVs using the relationship sdlog=sqrt(log(CV^2+1)). 
       \code{low} and \code{up} are the lower and upper limit of distribution (if truncation is desired). 
       \code{unit} is the weight unit of catch (used in graph labels; default="MT"). If "unif", the
       \code{catch} must be incorporated in \code{low} and \code{up} arguments.  For instance, if the 
       lower limit to sample is the value of \code{catch}, specify \code{low}=catch. If some maximum 
       above catch will be the upper limit, specify \code{up}=50*catch.  The limits for each year will 
       be applied to catch internally.

  \item{maxn}{the maximum limit of the Pella-Tomlinson shape parameter that should not be 
      exceeded in the rule for accepting a run.}  
  \item{k}{list arguments for estimation of  \code{k} (carrying capacity). \code{low} and \code{up} are 
   the lower and upper bounds of the minimization routine and \code{tol} is the tolerance level 
   for minimization. A simple equation \code{((btk)-(b[refyr]/k))^2} is used as
   the objective function. R function \code{optimize} is used to find \code{k}. \code{btk} is described 
   below. \code{permax} is the absolute percent difference between the maximum biomass estimate
   and \code{k} that should not be exceeded in the rule for accepting a run (see \code{details}).

    for selected distributions. The following are valid distributions: "none", "unif" - uniform, 
    "norm" - normal, "lnorm" - log-normal, "gamma" - gamma, and "beta" - beta distributions. 
    "unif" requires non-missing values for \code{low} and \code{up}. "norm", "lnorm", 
    "gamma" and "beta" require non-missing values for \code{low},\code{up}, \code{mean} and 
    \code{sd}. If "lnorm" is used, \code{mean} and \code{sd} must be on the natural log scale
    (keep \code{low} and \code{up} on the original scale). If \code{dist}= "none", the mean is used as

    "norm" - normal, "lnorm" - log-normal, "gamma" - gamma, and "beta" - beta distributions. 
    "unif" requires non-missing values for \code{low} and \code{up}. "norm", "lnorm", 
    "gamma" and "beta" require non-missing values for \code{low},\code{up}, \code{mean} and 
    \code{sd}. If "lnorm" is used, \code{mean} and \code{sd} must be on the natural log scale
    (keep \code{low} and \code{up} on the original scale). If \code{dist}= "none", the mean is used as

\details{
The method of Dick and MAcCall (2011) is used to produce estimates of MSY where only catch and 
information on resilience and current relative depletion is known. 

The  delay-difference model is used to propogate biomass: 
 
    B[t+1]<-B[t]+P[Bt-a]-C[t]

where \code{B[t]} is biomass in year t, \code{P[Bt-a]} is latent annual production based 
on parental biomass \code{agemat} years earlier and \code{C[t]} is the catch in year 
t. Biomass in the first year is assumed equal to \code{k}.

If Bmsy/k>=0.5, then P[t] is calculated as

P[t]<-g*MSY*(B[t-agemat]/k)-g*MSY*(B[t-agemat]/k)^n

where MSY is k*Bmsy/k*Umsy, n is solved iteratively using the equation, Bmsy/k=n^(1/(1-n)),
 and g is (n^(n/(n-1)))/(n-1). Fmsy is calculated as Fmsy=Fmsy/M*M and Umsy is calculated as 
(Fmsy/(Fmsy+M))*(1-exp(-Fmsy-M)).

If Bsmy/k < 0.5, Bjoin is calculated based on linear rules:
If Bmsy/k<0.3, Bjoin=0.5*Bmsy/k*k
If Bmsy/k>0.3 and Bmsy/k<0.5, Bjoin=(0.75*Bmsy/k-0.075)*k
 
If any B[t-a]<Bjoin, then the Schaefer model is used to calculated P:

P[Bt-agematt<Bjoin]<-B[t-agemat]*(P(Bjoin)/Bjoin+c(B[t-agemat]-Bjoin))

where c =(1-n)*g*MSY*Bjoin^(n-2)*K^(-n)
 
Biomass at MSY is calculated as: Bmsy=(Bmsy/k)*k

The overfishing limit (OFL) is Umsy*B[termyr].

\code{length(year)+1} biomass estimates are made for each run.

The rule for accepting a run is:
if(min(B)>0 && max(B)<=k && 

(objective function minimum<=tol^2) && abs(((max(B)-k)/k)*100)<=permax 
&& n<=maxn

If using the R Gui (not Rstudio), run 

      graphics.off()
  	windows(width=10, height=12,record=TRUE)
      .SavedPlots <- NULL

before running the dbsra function to recall plots.

\value{
  \item{Initial}{dataframe containing the descriptive statistics for each explored parameter.}
  \item{Parameters}{dataframe containing the mean, median, 2.5th and 97.5% percentiles, minumum and maximum
       of the plausible (accepted: likelihood(ll)=1) parameters. }  
  \item{Estimates}{dataframe containing the mean, median, 2.5th and 97.5% percentiles, minimum and maximum 
        of the management quantities (i.e., MSY, Bmsy, etc.) from the plausible parameters 
        (likelihood=1)}

       quantities for all (likelihood=0 and likelihood=1) random draws.}

 \item{end1yr}{value of the last year of catch data + 1 for use in function \code{dlproj}.}
 \item{type}{designates the output object as a \code{catchmsy} object for use in function \code{dlproj}.}

 The biomass estimates from each simulation are not stored in memory but are automatically 
     saved to a .csv file named "Biotraj-dbsra.csv". Yearly values for each simulation are stored across 
     columns.  The first column holds the likelihood values for each simulation (1= accepted, 0 = rejected).  
     The number of rows equals the number of simulations (\code{nsims}). This file is loaded to plot
      graph 13 and it must be present in the default or \code{setwd()} directory.  
    
  When \code{catchout}=1,   catch values randomly selected are saved to a .csv file named "Catchtraj-dbsra.csv". 
     Yearly values for each simulation are stored across columns.  The first column holds the likelihood 
     values (1= accepted, 0 = rejected).  The number of rows equals the number of simulations (\code{nsims}).   
  
 Use \code{setwd()} before running the function to change the directory where .csv files are stored.
