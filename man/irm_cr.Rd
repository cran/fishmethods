\details{
Jiang et al (2007) provides an extension of the Hoenig et al. (1998) instantaneous tag return model to account for 
catch/release of tagged fish. The benefits of this instantaneous rates model are that data from tagged fish that 
are recaptured and released alive are directly incorporated in the estimation of fishing and natural mortality.  
Jiang et al. models mortality of harvested fish and the mortality experienced by the tag because fish are often 
released after the tag has been removed. Therefore, additional tag mortality parameters are estimated in the model. 
The age-independent model of Jiang et al. is implemented here and initial tag loss and reporting rates are assumed 
known.  This model assumes that tagged fish are fully-recruited to the fishery and that fishing took place throughout
the year.  Similar to Hoenig et al. (1998), observed recovery matrices from the harvest and catch/release fish with 
removed tags are compared to expected recovery matrices to estimate model parameters. Asymmetric recovery matrices 
are allowed (recovery years > release years). All summary statistics follow Burnham and Anderson (2002).  Model 
degrees of freedom are calculated as the number of cells from the harvested and released recapture matrices 
and not-seen vector minus the number of estimated parameters. Total chi-square is calculated by summing cell 
chi-square values for all cells of the harvest, released, and not seen matrices. C-hat, a measure 
of overdispersion, is estimated by dividing the total chi-square value by the model degrees of freedom. Pooling 
of cells to achieve an expected cell value of 1 is performed and pooled chi-square and c-hat metrics are 
additionally calculated.Pearson residuals are calculated by subtracting the observed numbers of recoveries in each 
cell from the predicted numbers of recoveries and dividing each cell by the square-root of the predicted cell value. 
The variance of instantaneous total mortality (Z) is calculated by \code{varF + hmrate^2*varFA + varM + 2*sum(cov(F,M)+
hmrate^2*cov(F,FA)+hmrate^2*cov(FA,M))}, and the variance of survival (S) is calculated from Z using the delta method.  
The \code{optim} routine is used to find the parameters that minimize the -1*negative log-likelihood.

The program allows the configuration of different model structures (biological realistic models) for the estimation of
fishing, natural, and tag mortalities.  Consider the following examples:

\emph{Example 1}

Release years range from 1991 to 2003 and recovery years from 1991 to 2003.  One model structure might be constant 
fishing mortality estimates over the recovery years of 1991-1994 and 1995-2003, one constant estimate of tag mortality 
and one constant estimate of natural mortality for the entire recovery period.  To designate this model structure, 
the beginning year of each interval is assigned to the \code{Fyr} vector (e.g.,\code{Fyr<-c(1991, 1995)}), and the 
beginning year of the recovery period is assigned to the \code{FAyr} vector and the \code{Myr} vector 
(e.g., \code{FAyr<-c(1991)}; \code{Myr<-c(1991)}).  The first value of each vector must always be the beginning year
of the recovery period regardless of the model structure.

\emph{Example 2}

Release years range from 1991 to 2003 and recovery years from 1991 to 2003.  One model might be fishing and tag 
mortality estimates for each year of recovery years and two constant estimates of natural mortality for 1991-1996 and
1997-2003.  To designate this model structure, one value for each year is assigned to the Fyr and FAyr 
vectors (e.g., Fyr<-c(1991,1992,1993,1994,1995,1996,1997, 1998,1999,2000,2001,2002,2003 and
FAyr<-c(1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003)), and the 
beginning years of the natural mortality intervals are assigned to the Myr vector (e.g.,Myr<-c(1991,1997)).

Averaging of model results can be accomplished using the function \code{tag_model_avg}.
