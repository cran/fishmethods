reporting rate (lambda)

  \item{N}{vector of total number of tagged fish released in each release year (one value per year).}

\details{
The instantaneous tag return model of Hoening et al. (1998) assuming known initial tag loss and reporting rates is
implemented. This model assumes that tagged fish are fully-recruited to the fishery and that fishing took place 
throughout the year.  The observed recovery matrices are compared to expected recovery matrices to estimate model 
parameters. Asymmetric recovery matrices are allowed (recovery years > release years). All summary statistics follow 
Burnham and Anderson (2002).  Model degrees of freedom are calculated as the number of non-zero cells in the 
harvested recovery matrix minus the number of estimated parameters. Total chi-square is calculated by 
summing cell chi-square values for all cells of the harvest, released, and not seen matrices.
C-hat, a measure of overdispersion, is estimated by dividing the total chi-square value by the model degrees of freedom.
Pooling of cells to achieve an expected cell value of 1 is performed and pooled chi-square and c-hat metrics are 
additionally calculated. Pearson residuals are calculated by subtracting the observed numbers of recoveries in each 
cell from the predicted numbers of recoveries and dividing each cell by the square-root of the predicted cell value. 
The \code{optim} routine is used to find the parameters that minimize the -1*negative
log-likelihood. The variance of instantaneous total mortality (Z) is calculated by \code{varF + varM + 2cov(F,M)}, and
the variance of survival (S) is estimated from the variance of Z using the delta method.

The program allows the configuration of different model structures (biological realistic models) for the estimation of
fishing and natural mortalities.  Consider the following examples:

\emph{Example 1}

Release years range from 1991 to 2003 and recovery years from 1991 to 2003.  One model structure might be constant 
fishing mortality estimates over the recovery years of 1991-1994 and 1995-2003, and one constant estimate of natural
mortality for the entire recovery period.  To specify this model structure, the beginning year of each interval is 
assigned to the \code{Fyr} vector (e.g.,Fyr<-c(1991, 1995)), and the beginning year of the recovery period 
is assigned to the \code{Myr} vector  (e.g.,Myr<-c(1991)).  The first value of each vector must always be
 the beginning year of the recovery period regardless of the model structure.

\emph{Example 2}

Release years range from 1991 to 2003 and recovery years from 1991 to 2003.  One model might be fishing mortality 
estimates for each year of recovery years and two constant estimates of natural mortality for 1991-1996 and
1997-2003.  To specify this model structure, one value for each year is assigned to the Fyr vector 
(e.g., Fyr<-c(1991,1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003) and the beginning 
years of the natural mortality intervals are assigned to the Myr vector (e.g.,Myr<-c(1991, 1997)).

Averaging of model results can be accomplished using the function \code{tag_model_avg}.
